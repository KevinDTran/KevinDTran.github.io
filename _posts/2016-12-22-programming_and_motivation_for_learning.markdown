As a sorta' young professional and current student, some days can be a drag. There are days where a problem arises in which you cannot circumvent or even fully understand. I've experienced these situations multiple times at work and recently  as a student navigating my way through the `Learn` lessons. It's disheartening when you realize nothing you're doing/trying is getting past those pesky `failure` messages. It's at these times however when brute force and will-power is the most effective. When I gotten stuck at these impasses, I had to resolve to keep going at the issue through multiple sessions spanning multiple days. It's after these long hours or even days of going hitting the wall that I will eventually hit that breaking point when all the failure messages and red text fall away to the glorious green text of success. The resulting feeling of relief and immense feeling of accomplishment is almost worth the instant gratification. However, knowing that I am capable of succeeding against these walls is something that will stick with me long after.
