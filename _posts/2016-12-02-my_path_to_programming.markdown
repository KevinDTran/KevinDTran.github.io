As a young student, computers weren't much more to me than glorified typewriters, that is- until I was thrust into the real world. Throughout my undergraduate degree, computers were only used to type up papers, or casually browse the internet. It wasn't until I was worked in a research lab that I realized the true power and potential of computers. I realized a computer was still just a tool that could perform certain tasks exponentially faster than I could ever imagine. In order to become more efficient and useful in the workplace, I needed to learn how to leverage these tools. I never had the opportunity to do this until I got my latest job. Encouraged by my employers as well as my peers, I applied to Flatiron's developer course and am now starting my journey into computer literacy!
