Like many other individuals, I learned about Flatiron's online course through my coworkers. I have a dayjob and therefore I usually split my business hours with work and studying. This leads to a frequently fractured train of thought as well as slow course progression. I have found that some lessons have oddly worded goals and tests. I'm unsure if this is my fault or due to the assignment itself, however I've found that some assignments may take multiple days, and others a few minutes. I have learned that asking questions have been my weakest point. I don't have a computer science background and therefore experience issues understanding explainations from other students. This can be frustrating. It's only after mulling over the details for an extended period of time that i'll understand what's been explained to me.

In order to address my frustrations, I plan on blocking out time for studying only as well as asking questions if something blocks my progress for more than half an hour. I've spoken to a few other students and am glad I'm not the only one hitting walls.
